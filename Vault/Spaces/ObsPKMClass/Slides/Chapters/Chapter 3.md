### Implementing zettelkasten in obsidian

An opportunity to think about how you think.

Many different approaches, choose one that feels most clear, understandable and simple to you. 

After a while you may decide to change which is relatively easy.

---

### Implementation considerations

- Folders
- Templates
- Data fields (dataview)
- Daily notes

---

### Beyond zettelkasten

::: block <!-- element class="fragment fade-out" -->
<span class="obs-emph-normal">Obsidian</span> is not just zettelkasten. Think of it more like your office which contains a zettelkasten.
:::

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: -3em" -->
We can also use <span class="obs-emph-normal">Obsidian</span> for:
- Planning and task management
- Journalling/Logging
- Reflection
- Creation
:::

---

### Folders

::: block <!-- element class="fragment fade-out" style="margin-top: -0.5em"  -->
I'm using the ACCESS structure from [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com) 
:::

::: block  <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-top: -2.5em"  -->
- <span class="access">A</span>tlas (mocs)
- <span class="access">C</span>ards (evergreen notes)
- <span class="access">C</span>alendar (daily notes)
- <span class="access">E</span>xtras (templates, images, drawings, etc)
- <span class="access">S</span>ources (literature notes)
- <span class="access">S</span>paces (production notes)
:::

note:
An additional directory is actually needed for the fleeting notes. 


---

### Folders

Go ahead and create these folders in your vault.

You will need one additional folder for your fleeting notes. Name the folder "`+ Fleeting`". 

Using the + sign just keeps the directory at the top of the list. <!-- element class="fragment fade-in-then-out" style="margin-top: 1em" -->

::: block <!-- element class="fragment " style="margin-top: -2.5em" -->
I guess we should call it <span class="my-emph">ACCESS+</span>
:::

---

#### Folders <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0em;" -->
<video data-autoplay controls width="800" height="600"><source src="Spaces/ObsPKMClass/Resources/Folders.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <!-- element style="margin-top: 0em;" -->

---

### Templates

::: block <!-- element class="fragment fade-out" -->
- Provide a pre-defined structure for similar notes
- Applied/imported with Ctrl-T
- Enforce consistency
- Ensure necessary metadata are included with each note
:::

It's easier to just show you <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top:-5em" -->

note:
Set the directory in Settings/Templates

---

#### Templates <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0em;" -->
<video data-autoplay controls width="800" height="600"><source src="Spaces/ObsPKMClass/Resources/Templates.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <!-- element style="margin-top: 0em;" -->

---

### Considerations 

#### Filenames
- Descriptive containing key words in the note or topic
- They can be as long as you want 
- Freely use spaces, dashes, underscores, avoid other punctuation

---

### Considerations 

#### Writing notes
::: block <!-- element class="fragment fade-out" -->
- Never copy paste text into your notes except quotes and code
- Everything must be in your own words 
- If you can't say it yourself you don't understand it
:::  

Oftentimes I think I understand something until I need to state it and then I become aware of what was still fuzzy to me. <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top:-4.5em" -->
