### Zettelkasten

> [!tip] Wikipedia
> AÂ **_Zettelkasten_**Â (German: "slip box", pluralÂ **_ZettelkÃ¤sten_**) orÂ **card file**Â consists of small items of information stored on paper slips or cards that may be linked to each other throughÂ [subject headings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term "Index term")Â or otherÂ [metadata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata")Â such as numbers andÂ [tags](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata) "Tag (metadata)")

### Zettelkasten Users

> Over the decades, cards put to personal use have provided aesthetic and intellectual inspiration to myriad artists, writers, and designers."

### Zettelkasten Origins <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->

- Earliest examples from 16th century
- Became common among European scholars in the 19th century <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Famously used by Carl Linnaeus in developing the modern system of biological taxonomy <!-- element class="fragment" -->

### A  17$^{th}$ century example

<!-- .slide: style="padding: 2em;" -->
### $20^{th}$ century

- Little used in the US until the $20^{th}$ century
- Scholars still kept notes in books, or slips pasted in books <!-- element class="fragment" -->

### The computer age

Information stored digitally allows for greater volume and quicker retrieval

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" -->
<span class="my-emph">**However**</span> 
:::
Note-taking practices in the US did not change. So quicker...   <!-- element class="fragment" -->

but not that much quicker.   <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

### The computer age

Many students take notes by making a file for each class, or section, or chapter. This is like annotating books. And the more information, the more files to look through to find what you want.

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" -->
<span class="my-emph">*We need a change of paradigm*</span>
:::

---

### Zettelkasten to the rescue

Book/notebook style note-taking is inherently inefficient!

And the more information, the slower the retrieval. <!-- element class="fragment" --> 

We need to apply the principles of Zettelkasten using powerful tools such as <!-- element class="fragment" --> 

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" -->
<span class="obs-emph">**Obsidian**</span> 
:::

---

### Enter <span class="obs-emph-normal" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">Obsidian</span>

Software like <span class="obs-emph-normal">Obsidian</span> has been developed that allows us to truly implement a zettelkasten system with

1. Flexible use of metadata  <!-- element class="fragment" --> 
2. Rich method for cross referencing data <!-- element class="fragment" --> 
3. Ease of incorporating non-textual elements <!-- element class="fragment" --> 
4. Ease of creating references and footnotes <!-- element class="fragment" --> 

---

### Enter <span class="obs-emph-normal">Obsidian</span>

5. Powerful search function to ensure that nothing gets lost
6. Your actual notes and all of your data are stored in text files and other non proprietary formats so they can be used independently of obsidian  <!-- element class="fragment" --> 
7. Follows the principal that your data is your own to do what you want with  <!-- element class="fragment" --> 
8. It's free  <!-- element class="fragment" --> 

---

### No laughing matter

Not convinced yet? Other famous zettelkasteners include:

- George Carlin <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Phyllis Diller <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top:-0.25em" -->
- Joan Rivers <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top:-0.25em" -->
- Bob Hope <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top:-0.25em" -->

Zettelers! ðŸ¤£  <!-- element class="fragment fade-in-then-out" style="margin-top: 0.5em" -->

Sorry ðŸ˜Œ <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: -1em" -->

### Atomic notes

1. Short ideas or pieces of information (atoms) <!-- element class="fragment" -->
2. Think index card size <!-- element class="fragment" -->
3. Self-contained and understandable without reference to other information <!-- element class="fragment" -->
4. May change or evolve over time <!-- element class="fragment" -->
5. Should contain metatdata <!-- element class="fragment" -->
	- references (links to other notes) <!-- element style="margin-top: 0.5em" -->
	- hierarchy (parent, sibling, next)
	- tags (flexible)

note:

Making atomic notes become part of the learning process. It forces you to clarify your understanding of every point.

Working with Zettelkasten forces/nudges you to think about your thinking.

You may return to your notes when you gain more information or insight relating to the topic. 

You may want to add metadata.

Don't get too obsessed with the size. Just keep in mind that broad topics are for other types of notes (mocs or production notes)

---

### Fleeting notes

For quickly capturing
- Undeveloped ideas  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Interesting information you encounter <!-- element class="fragment" -->
<br />

Before you forget them ðŸ˜‰ <!-- element class="fragment" -->

Fleeting notes will evolve into permanent notes or be discarded.  <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

Immediacy is important so that you can get back to ideas and information and not forget about them

There is no harm keeping them around though so don't be quick to discard. Maybe you should come back to it later. You could even note how many times you had looked at the note with metadata.

You are encouraged not to return immediately to your fleeting notes. It's often better to return to them later.

---

### Permanent notes

Two types:

1. Literature notes
2. Your ideas, observations, etc.

After you've processed a fleeting note to ensure that it is atomic and has the appropriate metadata, then <!-- element class="fragment" -->

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" -->
<span class="my-emph">File it...</span><span class="obs-emph-normal"> *it's a permanent note*.</span>
:::

### Production Notes

I find it useful to distinguish an additional type of note. <!-- element class="fragment fade-out" -->

Production notes are <!-- element class="fragment fade-in" style="margin-top: -1.5em" -->

- Longer documents which develop or expose your ideas drawing on notes in your vault  <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 0.25em" -->
- They incorporate non-textual elements such as images, drawings, graphs, charts, dataqueries, etc.  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Form the basis for published articles, essays, books, videos, etc  <!-- element class="fragment"  -->

---

### Daily Notes

These are not traditional zettelkasten notes. <!-- element class="fragment fade-out" style="margin-top: -0.5em"  -->

Daily notes provide a place to <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: -1.5em" -->

- Organize your work  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Reflect on your day and your work  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Set goals  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Document your work  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Make log entries  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
