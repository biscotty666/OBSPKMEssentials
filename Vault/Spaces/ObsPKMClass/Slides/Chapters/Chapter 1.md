### Obsidian and PKM Essentials

#### In this chapter we will cover: <!--element style="margin: 1em" -->

1. [[Chapter 1|Intro to PKM]] <!-- element class="fragment" -->
2. Installing Obsidian and making your first note <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 0.5em;" -->
3. Basics of markdown <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 0.5em;" -->
4. Navigating Obsidian <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 0.5em;" -->

note:
In the first part (this presentation) we start with an explanation of the concept of PKM

In the second part, with videos and screenshots, we will go through the process of installing Obsidian and writing a simple note

Since markdown is the format in which you make notes, we will go through the basics of markdown. This may be a video as well

Finally we will spend some time learning how to navigate Obsidian. This will likely be primarily video as well

### Personal Knowledge Management
> [!tip] Wikipedia
> Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to __gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share__ knowledge in their daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities... It is a bottom-up approach to knowledge management.
<!-- element style="width:95%"-->

---

### Zettelkasten Users

> [!tip] Frank Halasz
> Its intended users are authors, researchers, designers, and other intellectual laborers engaged in analyzing information, constructing models, formulating arguments, designing artifacts, and generally processing ideas. 

---

### The traditional approach  


People have many methods for note-taking:  <!-- element align="left" -->

- Notebooks <!-- element class="fragment"  -->
- Folders and cabinets <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Index Cards <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- PDAs <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Computers <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

### The traditional approach  

__But...__ <!-- element style="color:red; margin-top:10px;""-->

How do you find the information again? How long does it take? <!-- element class="fragment" -->

__And...__ <!-- element class="fragment"  style="color:red;"-->

In practice, the more extensive your notes the less accessible any piece of information is! <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:
The traditional approach to taking notes is to make detailed notebooks with pages full of notes with dividers for each subject/section. Some people we'll make extensive use of highlighters in books. Some people take their notes on index cards which then are stored in boxes piled one on top of another.

Keeping your notes on a computer is somewhat better since it's easy to have your files with you at all times and you can search through any individual file much easier.. assuming you know which file to look in.

In a way, the better, more extensive your notes the slower your retrieval process even if you're clever about it. 

The challenge is getting information back out. And not just next week, maybe next year or in 2 years. Maybe you are writing an article and there are notes you took a long time ago that you forgot about but that are relevant.

---

Let's look at the way Personal Knowledge Management, in conjunction with Obsidian, addresses each part of the definition given above.

- Gather 
- Classify
- Store 
- Search and retrieve 
- Share 

---

### And add one more

## Discover new relationships <!-- element class="fragment" style="color: red; margin-top:1em;" -->

---

### Gather
#### Two main kinds of information <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1em;"  -->
1. Media (books, articles, videos, etc.) <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-top: 1em;"-->
2. Your brain! <!-- element class="fragment" -->

#### Note-taking techniques:  <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1.5em;"-->
1. Atomic notes <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1em;" -->
2. Fleeting notes <!-- element class="fragment" -->
3. Maps of content <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

There are two main sources of information: media like books and video that you consume and your own ideas and thoughts.

For books and video we rely on a particular system of note taking which focuses on atomic notes. We will cover this a lot more later but the general idea is that notes should be stored as small complete and independent pieces of information, like index cards.

Fleeting notes: For your own thoughts and ideas obsidian allows you to quickly jot things down as they occur to you, to which you can then go back later and ponder, _develop_, classify, or delete.

Atomic notes: Discussing the concept of atomic notes and why they are important. Mention index cards and  __Zettlekasten__.

Maps of content: Organizing and distilling your notes

---

### Classify

- Review your note to ensure clarity <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1em;" -->
- Relate the note to at least one other note <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Tag the note to describe it's nature and/or content <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

Once you have taken a note it is important to classify it somehow in your system, in your card catalog so to speak. 

There are many ways to do this and personal preference comes into your decision. Obsidian is nice because you can always change your mind if you decide that the organization that you've chosen isn't working out for you or you just want to expand on it.

This is a good time to think about how this note relates to other notes in your vault. But don't worry, Obsidian's  search is so powerful that it will retrieve information even if it's not explicitly tied to other information.

---

### Store

- All notes are plain text <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1em;" -->
- Notes are stored locally on your computer <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Storage for life <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Any directory can be opened "as a vault" in Obsidian <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Backing up and copying notes or vaults are simple file operations <!-- element class="fragment" -->


note:

Obsidian stores all of your notes in plain text files on your computer. Which means all of your information is yours and will always be accessible no matter what happens with Obsidian itself. So this is storage for life. And since they are just text files in directories and __any directory can be opened as a vault__. 

---

### Store

You are not tied to any specific 
- software
- vendor
- data models
- versions
- restrictions or requirements.

---

### Search and retrieve

Here we really leverage the power of Obsidian. We will spend time later going through all of the ways you can <span class="my-emph">quickly</span>:

1. Find specific information you are looking for <!-- element class="fragment" -->
2. Collect all of your information on any given topic <!-- element class="fragment" -->

Nothing gets lost! <!-- element class="fragment" style="color: red;" -->
note:
The more atomic your notes, the easier it is!

---

### Share

::: block <!-- element class="fragment fade-out" -->
There are many ways you can share information from your vault.
- Send someone a copy of files, directories or your entire vault directory
- Keep a copy of your vault in cloud storage like GitHub
:::

::: block <!-- element class="fragment fade-in-then-out" style="margin-top: -6em" --> 
And most important:
:::

Create something! <!-- element class="fragment" -->

Write an article, make a video, create drawings and images... <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

1. Since they are just text files you can simply send them to someone else and they can put them in their own vault and open them up and look at them.
2. You can put your vault online or in the cloud, using something like github.org where other people can view whatever information you want to share.
3. You can write articles or -_produce new_ videos from the information and ideas you have in your vault.

---

### Discovery of relationships

- As your vault grows the number of related notes grow  <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1em;" -->
- These inter-connected notes become a neural network <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Out of the network new relationships emerge <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Gain insights and new ideas <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- And when you reach "critical mass" with an idea...create something! <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

This wasn't part of the definition above but it is an important way to use your vault.

As your vault grows, you will have more and more interrelated information. 

Obsidian makes it easy to discover related notes and information even if you were not aware of the relationship when you made the note.

Over time the network will have so many connections notes that patterns and relationships will emerge.

---

### Next steps

Let's install Obsidian and make some notes!

- Blockquotes <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Tags <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Images, footnotes, codeblocks,  etc. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

### Headers <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->

Create sections in your notes

- A line which starts with one or more # symbols (up to 6) followed by a space<!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Provides formatting <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- And hierarchical structure <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Generates "folds" which can be used to hide parts of notes <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->

---

#### Headers <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0em;" -->
<video data-autoplay controls width="800" height="600"><source src="Spaces/ObsPKMClass/Resources/Headers.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <!-- element style="margin-top: 0em;" -->

---

### Emphasis <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->

Wrap text in delimiters <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->

| Effect          |                Use                 |
|:--------------- |:----------------------------------:|
| Bold/Strong     |              __ or **              |
| Italic/Emphasis |              _ or **               |
| Combined        | Use both asterisks and underscores |
| Strike-through  |                 ~~                 |
|                 |                                    |

---

#### Emphasis <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0em;" -->
<video data-autoplay controls width="800" height="600"><source src="Spaces/ObsPKMClass/Resources/Emphasis.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <!-- element style="margin-top: 0em;" -->

---

### Lists <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->

Create numbered and bullet point lists  <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->

| List type               |      Start a line with       |
|:----------------------- |:----------------------------:|
| Unordered/bullet points |         \*, +, or -          |
| Ordered/numbered        | a digit followed by a period |
|                         |                              |

To create sub-lists/nested lists press the tab key to indent a list item

---

#### Lists <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0em;" -->
<video data-autoplay controls width="800" height="600"><source src="Spaces/ObsPKMClass/Resources/Lists.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <!-- element style="margin-top: 0em;" -->

---

### Links <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->
Simply typing a url automatically creates a link:
- https://obsidian.md

Show a description instead of the url: <!-- element style="margin-top: 0.5em;" -->

	```
	[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
	```
	
Produces: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

---

#### Links <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0em;" -->
<video data-autoplay controls width="800" height="600"><source src="Spaces/ObsPKMClass/Resources/Links.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <!-- element style="margin-top: 0em;" -->

---

### Links <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->
You can also link to other notes in your vault this way, but you really don't want to 😉. We will soon learn about "backlinks"

---

### Blockquotes <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->

You can start a line with > to begin a blockquote.

```
>This is an example
>of a blockquote.
>I will make it long enough that you can see the full effect in ths slide.
```

Produces:

>This is an example
>of a blockquote
>I will make it long enough that you can see the full effect.

---

### Tags <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->

Tags are flexible and can be used to identify:

- Type <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Topic <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Source <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Action <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->

note:

Examples:

|        |                Tags                |
|:------ |:----------------------------------:|
| Type   | #moc #note/reference#note/fleeting |
| Topic  |        #on/Obsidian#on/PKM         |
| Source | #source/presentation#source/Brian  |
| Action |    #to/watch #to/read#to/review    |

### Backlinks <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 1em;" -->

The glue that ties all you notes together
- Make links between notes <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Give aliases to your links <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Display the contents of one note in another note <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Used in maps of content  <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
- Can be used anywhere <!-- element class="fragment"  style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->
