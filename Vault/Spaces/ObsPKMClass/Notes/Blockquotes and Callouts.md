## Blockquotes and Callouts

Start a line with > followed by a space.

> This is a blockquote.
> Quite simple, really, don't you think?

Blockquotes can be nested

> "This is a quotation
> From a very famous person"
> > __- Famous Person__

To make a card style blockquote, put `[!quote]` on the first line

> [!quote]
> Here's something else
> he said
> > **- Some guy**

You can add text after the  `[!quote]` . Leave a space between the closing bracket and your text.

> [!quote] Profound statement 
> Here's something else
> he said
> __- Some guy__

Add a + or - after `[!quote]` to make a foldable card. + defaults to unfolded and - defaults to folded. Do not leave a space between the closing bracket and the + or -.

> [!quote]- Some guy said
> Here's something else
> he said

Blockquotes and callouts can contain formatting, links and backlinks.
