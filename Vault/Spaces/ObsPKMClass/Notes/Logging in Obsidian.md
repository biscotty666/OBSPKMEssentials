## Logging in Obsidian
### with Dataview 


### Motivation

Make a system to track activity and observational information.

### Goal

In this example I will create a system for logging my daily exercise. Typically I either walk or ride my bicycle. I do various routes and sometimes take pictures along the way. I use a mobile application to map my routes and provide details for my workout and I can share them to my vault where I can display them in a note. I would like to capture all of this information in a daily log. I would then like to display this information in an exercise log.

### Implementation

1. Add fields to the daily note template
```
Exercise Type:: 
Exercise Duration:: 
Exercise Distance:: 
Exercise Route:: 
Exercise Image:: 
Exercise Notes:: 
```
1. Create a daily note and make some entries 
2. Create another note with a Dataview query to display information 
```
```dataview
Table
```
