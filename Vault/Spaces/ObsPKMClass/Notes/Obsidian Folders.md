#### Folders

I'm using the ACCESS structure from [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com) 
- **A**tlas (mocs)
- **C**ards (evergreen notes)
- **C**alendar (daily notes)
- **E**xtras (templates, images, drawings, etc)
- **S**ources (literature notes)
- **S**paces (products)

Plus we need an additional folder for fleeting notes. Directories are sorted alphabetically. By starting the name with a + sign we can get this directory at the top. So
- \+ New (fleeting notes)
