## Recurring tasks


- Start with the keyword `every`
- Add `when done` to make the date of the new recurring task based on the completion date and not the original due date

Examples:

游대 every 3 days
游대 every 10 days when done
游대 every weekday (meaning every Mon - Fri)
游대 every week on Sunday
游대 every month on the last
游대 every 6 months on the 2nd last Friday
