## Codeblocks

Codeblocks are used to display text without formatting it. This preserves indentations and special characters, and they are commonly used to display programming code.

We will use them later when, for example, making dataview queries.

Codeblocks are wrapped in backticks (upper left key on the keyboard). Single backticks declare an in-line code block. Three backticks declare block formatting. I cannot show you in-line, you need to try it yourself, but here is the block version:

```
This is an example of a codeblock $ # %
```
