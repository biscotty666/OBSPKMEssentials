## Dataview Queries

__Note__:
- queries can be very simple or very complex
- query results are automatically updated 
- key words such as FROM and WHERE can be upper or lower case
- line breaks are optional
- fields can be:
	- combined with `AND` and  `OR`
	- aliased with `AS`
	- multiple fields can be separated with a comma
	- put a - before a field to negate inclusion (FROM clause)
- You can use JavaScript to write queries allowing for sophisticated manipulation with calculated fields
