## Daily note template Content

Let's start with some frontmatter. Create a file Extras/Templates/Daily Note and add

```
---
date: {{date}}
tags: #log/journal #note/daily 
---
```

Then create a basic layout with headers. I've added some JavaScript at the end. I'm not going to explain it now, so just go with it ðŸ˜‰

Note that since we are putting these log entries on the daily note we don't need a date field for it since we can get the date from the file name.

```

tR += "![[" + [[yesterday]] + "]]"
%>
