![[Tasks Dates|Date fields for tasks]]


![[Recurring tasks]]

![[Priorities]]

## Statuses

We will only use the two basic statuses, checked or unchecked, indicated by `- [x]` and `- [ ]` and which correspond to `done` or `not done`

## Description

`description includes`

## Tags

Existence: `has tags`, `no tags`
`tags include`, `tags do not include`

## File properties

`path includes`, `path does not include`
`folder includes`, `folder does not include`
`filename includes`, `filename does not include`

## Limit

`limit 10`
`limit groups 3` when using sorting, limit of tasks in each group

## Sorting and grouping

`sort by`, `sort by <something> reverse`
multiple (nested) sorting by listing different criteria on different lines

`group by`

## Multiple filters

Each new line describes an `AND` operator. All standard boolean operators are recognized, `NOT`, `AND`, `OR`, `AND NOT`, `OR NOT` and `XOR`. Related filters must be wrapped in parentheses.
