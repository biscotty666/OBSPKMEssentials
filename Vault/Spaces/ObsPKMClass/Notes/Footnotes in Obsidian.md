#### Footnotes in Obsidian

Footnotes can be declared by putting a caret and a number in square brackets, eg.  `[^1]` after some text. Anywhere else in the note you declare the content of the footnote with `[^1]:`.

I would like to give this text a reference[^1]. And here[^2] is another.

[^1]:The content of the first reference

You can add the contents of the reference in-line as well with `^[in-line reference]` ^8f03aa

In this case I'll just make a citation^[This is the in-line citation] in-line.

Citations can contain links, formatting and back-links, as you can see from this quote from an earlier note[^3]

[^2]: The second citation we made earlier.

Notice that it automatically adjusts the numbering of the footnotes in display view
