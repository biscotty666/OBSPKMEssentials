## Install Obsidian

Obsidian is available for Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iPad and iPhone. It is free and can be installed from the [website](https://obsidian.md) and installed as normal.

### Linux users

I recommend the flatpak which can be installed with `flatpak install flathub md.obsidian.Obsidian`.
