## Graph view script

In this video I want to look at the functionality of obsidian's graph View. I have two goals for this video one which is to introduce you to to show you all of the different parameters in graph View and how you can use them. Secondly I want to use this graph View to give an explanation for what people mean when they say obsidian is your second brain.

So here we have graph you opened up and let me you can open it up by yada yada. All of the dots you see are individual notes in my vault. I have colored them depending on types of notes and that's mainly based on tags..

Now if I hover over one of these nodes you can see the name of the note you can see a little bit which notes they're connected to and if I click on the Note you'll see it opens up in a new tab.

Let me just turn up the visibility of the notes so you can see maybe a little bit better the names of the notes. For what I'm doing now I don't really want you to see them so I'll turn it back down.

Let's start by understanding what the graph is. It's actually what is referred to as a force graph. In this type of graph you have a bunch of nodes which are our obsidian notes in this case, and you have edges, or lines, which connect the notes. If I raise the visibility of the edges you can maybe see a little bit better what I mean.

A force graph is actually dynamic which you can see when I if I grab one of these notes and drag it around you can see how everything adjusts to the new location. If we open up the settings for the graph, which you can do by going to the upper right hand side and clicking on the gear icon. You have four categories here of settings 1 2 3 4 and we will go down here to graph settings whatever they call. 

The first Setter setting is Center Force. This determines how strongly all of the notes are drawn towards the center of the graph. You can use this if the edges. If the edges of the big circle get a little frayed looking. This is usually the last setting I just.

Then you have the link force. This determines how strongly linked nodes or linked notes are attracted to each other. You can see that if we increase the link Force the randomness of the notes as denoted by the different colors decreases and the different colors are dragged towards each other because of their links or edges.

Then you have the repel force. This is kind of the opposite of the link Force in that it pushes all the notes away from each other. By increasing the repel Force and the link Force you can more and more tightly group associated notes.

Finally you have the link distance. This determines the average length of the edges or lines that you see in the graph.

Notice that if we hover our mouse over a note we see the name of the note and we see linked notes also highlighted. We can of course click on this note and it will open the note in a new tab.

We can zoom in and out of the graph you by using the mouse wheel. Notice that when you zoom in it will zoom in on the area centered around your mouse pointer location so if you want to zoom in on a certain section point to that section before you zoom with your mouse.

In the display settings we can choose whether or not to display arrows showing the relationship between notes. The text threshold is used to decide at what zoom level the names of the notes get displayed. Node size and line thickness are pretty much self-explanatory.

Let's look at the filters section. This works just like your search, shift control f in your left sidebar. So if I type simply the word obsidian it will highlight will show only the notes that contain the word obsidian. I can also search by tag or file, really anything you can do in the left side search.

Here I can also specify a depth. If I increase the depth to two then I'm going to see all of the notes that are linked to the notes that I filtered. If I increase it another level then I can see all of the notes that are attached to those notes, and so on.

Finally under groups you can change the color for each note. By default they are all white. Here you can see I'm using tags to color code my notes. This works just like the search function again so you can tag you can colorize things based on file names or other attributes. I find tags to be convenient. Let me show you how you can add and delete groups. 

No let's go back to the first parameters and adjust them to get a sense of what's going on in our vault. Right now it looks quite random. If I increase the visibility of the links you can see there are things linked together but it is a bit of a mess. So let's increase the link Force so we can start drawing together different or connected notes. You can see by the colors how associated notes are starting to group themselves together.

Let's go ahead and increase the repel for as well. This will help push apart unassociated notes and further aid in our grouping.

We can also adjust the line length to make things clearer and we can adjust the center Force so that we don't have such raggedy edges.

Now the association's and groupings of notes are much clearer and more obvious.

Obsidian graph you also has a time lapse feature. It's a lot of fun to watch but it also gives you some insight into how your work has developed over time. As we watch this play out you'll see notes appear chronologically as I made them in the vault. You can see that at the beginning when I was using obsidian I was just kind of grading random somewhat random looking simple first notes. That was just my first learning notes. Now you can see where I'm starting to take actual notes for some study that I was doing. And now you can see my creation of a mock a map of content that draws together the notes on this topic. So now you can see a pretty rapid. Where I was taking a lot of notes on probability and statistics topics so you can see these new mocks maps of content springing into existence. There's one for r r is a programming language that is commonly used in data science. Notice down here we have a growing group of notes that pertain to obsidian. And this gives you some historical perspective on where you have focused your attention.
