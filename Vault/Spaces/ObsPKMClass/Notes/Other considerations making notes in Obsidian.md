## Some other important considerations

### Filenames
- Descriptive containing key words in the note or topic
- They can be as long as you want 
- Freely use spaces, dashes, underscores, avoid other punctuation

### Writing notes
- Never copy paste text into your notes except quotes and code
- Everything must be in your own words 
- If you can't say or explain something clearly you don't yet understand it
- Sometimes it's good to leave a note for a while before returning to it to make it a permanent note
