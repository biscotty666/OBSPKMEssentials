## Dataview

Dataview is a community plug-in and not part of base Obsidian. However it is so useful that I consider it an essential feature.

Dataview allows you to create queries to easily find and display notes and information about notes based on 
- tags
- filename or directory
- arbitrary fields you create

Dataview provides 4 types of queries, __LIST__, __TABLE__, __TASK__ and __CALENDAR__. Of these I personally only use TABLE and TASK.
