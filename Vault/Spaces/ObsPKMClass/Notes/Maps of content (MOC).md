#### Map of content (MOC)

- Organize your notes around a given topic of interest
- Not atomic
- They may begin as a simple list of notes
- Over time you can develop a structure or narrative incorporating your notes
- Eventually some will become rich enough to become a _Production Note_
- We will keep MOCs in the `Atlas` directory in our vault

#### Product

- A type of MOC
- Represent a product to be shared with others
- Articles, studies, books, blogs, videos, etc.
- We will keep them in the `Spaces` directory in our vault
