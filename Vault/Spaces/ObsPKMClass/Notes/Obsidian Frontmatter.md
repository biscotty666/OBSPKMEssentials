#### Frontmatter in Obsidian

Frontmatter is used to declare fields in Obsidian such as tags, aliases, hierarchical relationships and arbitrary fields. The frontmatter is not displayed in Read View 

Fields can also be declared [[Dataview Fields|inline]]. We will cover this topic extensively in the [[Dataview]] section.

To create frontmatter the first thing in the note _must_ be two lines with three dashes each. You will include the frontmatter as `key: value` pairs between these lines.

A common use of frontmatter is to declare an alias for a note with a long, unwieldy title by using the key word `aliases`.
