#### Frontmatter in Obsidian

Frontmatter is used to declare fields in Obsidian such as tags, aliases, hierarchical relationships and arbitrary fields. Fields can also be declared [[Dataview Fields|inline]]

To create frontmatter the first thing in the note _must_ be two lines with three dashes each. You will include the frontmatter as `key: value` pairs in the frontmatter.

A common use is to declare aliases where filenames are long.
