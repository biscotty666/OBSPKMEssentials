## Logging Video Script Long

Let's use data view to create a logging system. For this demonstration we will log observations of animals in my yard. I would particularly like to keep track of bird sightings, and I have a special interst in hummingbirds.

I'd like to be able to see my observations over time, and perhaps be able to compare them to prior years at the same time. In addition there are some species about which I'd like to learn more.

So I would like to have an Evergreen note which incorporates all of my sightings of the particular bird.

I'm going to start by demonstrating how I use the logging system and then we will walk through how I constructed the different parts.

First let's see how I make a log entry. I'll of course start by opening a new note. I can name the note anything but it is worthwhile being systematic about your naming. File names are very important to consider in obsidian because they are one of the primary ways of linking and referring to other notes and so descriptive names make things much easier.

So whenever I make an observation I'm going to give the file a name starting with obs, not obsidian LOL but observation, followed by the date. If I have already made an observation on the same day I will see it on the list can create a new notes just by adding .1.2.3 or something like that to the file name.

In my new note I'm going to apply my observation template which contains the basic metadata filds. Hit alt r to replace the templater templates for the date and time. Now if I know the species I can change unknown species and instead backlink to the actual species. Then I can add some notes if there is something unusual to mention, and also add a picture if I was quick enough to get my phone camera turned on. Actually hummingbirds tend to hang around for a while and are more curious of us than frightened.

I have Obsidian on my phone as well, and I synchronize with an application called syncthing. So I can add the picture to Obsidian on my phone and it will quickly appear here. I'll go ahead and do that behind the scenes.

Now we have an image. It's of course not mine, but I'll use it as an example.

Now let's look at our map of content that shows all of our backyard observations.

Here we can see all my observations with various time period groupings.
